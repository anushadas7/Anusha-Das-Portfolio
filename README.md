# [Project 2: Effect of Extra Curriculars on Academics](https://github.com/anushadas7/ECA-on-academics)
This is a reserch project which aims to understand the cause and effect of extra curricular activities on academics through Design of Experiments. Information was collected by circulating a questionnaire throughout the students of Delhi University who have been a part of an ECA Society or a club. After receiving responses from 200+ Students we made use of Factorial Experiments to carry out the appropriate analysis. In accordance with many reports and research papers published there is significant impact of Co-curricular activities on Grades, but our study has led us in a different direction concluding with the thought process that there is actually no significant influence of ECA Activities on the academic performance of a student throughout their college curriculum.
